{"title":"Readmill Epilogue","favicon":"images/favicon.ico","lang":"en","tags":[],"image":null,"videos":[],"text":"Three years ago, we set out to create an open, independent reading platform. We believed that the reading experience could be beautiful and that it was meant to be shared.\n\nAlong the way, we created a reading app for iOS and Android that proved these things to be true. We’re proud of the product we built, but even more so, we’re grateful for the community of readers that made it grow.\n\nAt every turn, your feedback shaped Readmill’s development, and your passion signaled a new chapter for reading. Together we wrote in the margins of ebooks and discussed our favorite passages from across the world. Thank you for helping to bring this reality into view.\n\nReadmill’s story ends here. Many challenges in the world of ebooks remain unsolved, and we failed to create a sustainable platform for reading. For this, we’re deeply sorry. We considered every option before making the difficult decision to end the product that brought us together.\n\nAs of today, it is no longer possible to create a new account, and on July 1, 2014, the Readmill app will no longer be available. For the next three months, our first priority is to help you transition to other services and get back to reading. All of your books and reading data are available for export in multiple formats.\n\nOur team will be joining Dropbox, where our expertise in reading, collaboration and syncing across devices finds a fitting home. Millions of people use Dropbox to store and share their digital lives, and we believe it’s a strong foundation on which to build the future of reading. We’re delighted to work alongside this talented team and imagine new ways to read together.\n\nThank you for the time and attention you’ve contributed to this community. It has been a privilege to read together, and we look forward to meeting again, in new ways, in the margins."}
