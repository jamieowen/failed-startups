Current customers have until then to download their files from the service. Beginning on that date, the web interface will no longer be accessible and the Mac app will stop working.\n\nCustomers on monthly subscription plans will be charged a pro-rata amount for the remaining term to April 11, 2015 if they renew between now and April 10.\n\nCustomers with annual subscriptions may request a pro-rata refund for the period from April 11, 2015, until the end of the contract period by contacting support@layervault.com no later than April 30, 2015.\n\nDesigner News, the community that we have been running for the last two years, will continue on.\n\nSome folks may be wondering: Why? We will try to share our experience as best we can via post-mortems and blog posts, but the short answer is simple: we failed to make LayerVault financially viable, exhausted our existing capital reserves, and were unable to secure additional capital to sustain uninterrupted service. We ran out of money. Although the service will cease, weâ€™re still hopeful that the technology may find a home.\n\nThank you to our customers, both current and former, for giving us your business.\n\nIf you have any questions about this shutdown, you can drop me an email: kelly@layervault.com."}
