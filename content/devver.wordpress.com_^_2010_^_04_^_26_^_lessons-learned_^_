	<div class="main">
		<p>As we&#8217;ve begun to wrap things up here at Devver, we&#8217;ve had the  chance to reflect a bit on our experience. Although shutting down is not  the outcome we wanted, it&#8217;s clear to both Dan and I that doing a  startup has been an amazing learning experience. While we still have a  lot to learn, we wanted to share some of the most important lessons  we&#8217;ve learned during this time.</p>
<p><strong>The community</strong></p>
<p>When we  started Devver, we were hesitant to ask for feedback and help. We  quickly found that people are incredibly helpful and generous with their  time. Users were willing to take a chance and use our products while  giving us valuable feedback. Fellow Rubyists gave us ideas and helped us  with technical problems. Mentors made time for meetings and introduced  us to others who could assist us. And other entrepreneurs, both new and  seasoned, were happy to share stories, compare experiences, and offer  support.</p>
<p>If you are working on a startup, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask  for help! The vast majority of people want to help you succeed, provided  that you respect them and their time. That means you need to prepare  adequately (do your research and ask good questions), figure out their  preferred methods of communication (e.g. don&#8217;t call if they prefer  email), show up on time, don&#8217;t overburden them, and thank them. And when  other people need your help, give back!</p>
<p>You can build awesome  relationships with various communities on your own, but we strongly  recommend joining a mentorship program like <a id="zc5_" title="TechStars" href="http://techstars.org/">TechStars</a>.  The program accelerated the process of connecting with mentors, users,  and other entrepreneurs by providing an amazing community during the  summer (and to this day). The advice, introductions, and support have  been simply incredible.</p>
<p><strong>Founding team</strong></p>
<p>Dan and I  are both technical founders. Looking back, it would have been to our  advantage to have a third founder who really loved the business aspect  of running a startup.</p>
<p>There is a belief (among technical  founders) that technical founders are sufficient for a successful  startup. Or, put more harshly, that <span><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;<a id="hto-" title="you can teach a hacker business, but you can't teach a  businessman how to hack" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=545559">you can teach a hacker business, but you can&#8217;t  teach a businessman how to hack</a>&#8220;. I don&#8217;t want to argue whether  that&#8217;s true or not. Clearly there are <a id="k.e4" title="examples" href="http://google.com/">examples</a> of technical founders being  sufficient to get a company going, but my point is that having solely  technical founders is non-optimal. You can teach a hacker business, but  you can&#8217;t make him or her get excited about it, which means it may not  get the time or attention it deserves.</span></span></p>
<p>Hackers are passionate  about, well, hacking. And so we tend to measure progress in terms of  features completed or lines of code written. Clearly, code needs to be  written, but ideally a startup would have a founder who is working on  important non-technical tasks: talking with customers, measuring key  metrics, developing distribution channels, etc. I&#8217;m not advocating that  only one founder works on these tasks while technical founders ignore  customer development &#8211; everyone needs to get involved. Rather, I&#8217;m  pointing out that given a choice, technical founders will tend to solve  problems technically and having a founder who has the opposite default  is valuable.</p>
<p><strong>Remote teams</strong></p>
<p>We embraced  working remotely: we hired <a id="fz5m" title="Avdi" href="http://avdi.org/">Avdi</a> to work in Pennsylvania while Dan and I lived in  Boulder and later on, Dan moved to Washington, DC. There are <a id="o9gf" title="many benefits" href="http://toni.org/2010/03/08/5-reasons-why-your-company-should-be-distributed/">many benefits</a> to having a  distributed team, but two stood out in our experience. First, we could  hire top talent without having to worry about location (in fact, our  flexibility regarding location was very attractive to most candidates we  interviewed). Secondly, being in different locations allowed every team  member to work with minimal distractions, which is invaluable when it  comes to efficiently writing good code.</p>
<p>That said, communication  was a challenge. To ensure we were all synced up, we had a daily standup  as well as a weekly review. When Dan moved to DC, he and I scheduled  another weekly meeting with no set agenda to just bring up all the  issues, large and small, that were on our minds. We also all got  together in the same location every few months to work in the same room  and rekindle our team energy.</p>
<p>Also, pair programming was  difficult to do remotely and we never came up with a great solution. As a  result, we spent less than a day pairing a week on average.</p>
<p>The  most significant drawback to a remote team is the administrative hassle.  It&#8217;s a pain to manage payroll, unemployment, insurance, etc in one  state. It&#8217;s a freaking nightmare to manage in three states (well, two  states and a district), even though we paid a <a id="f8-l" title="payroll service" href="http://www.paychex.com/">payroll  service</a> to take care of it. Apparently, once your startup gets  larger, there are <a id="hz2k" title="companies" href="http://administaff.com/">companies</a> that will manage this with minimal  hassle, but for a small team, it was a major annoyance and distraction.</p>
<p><strong>Product development</strong></p>
<p>Most of the mistakes we made developing our test  accelerator and, later, Caliper boiled down to one thing: we should have  focused more on customer development and finding a minimum viable  product (MVP).</p>
<p>The first thing we worked on was our Ruby test  accelerator. At the time, we thought we <em>had found</em> our MVP: we had  made encouraging technical progress and we had talked to several  potential customers who were excited about the product we were building.  Anything simpler seems &#8220;too simple&#8221; to be interesting.</p>
<p>Our  mistake at that point was to go &#8220;heads down&#8221; and focus on building the  accelerator while minimizing our contact with users and customers (after  all, we <em>knew</em> how great it was and time spent talking to  customers was time we could be hacking!). We should have asking, &#8220;Is  there an even simpler version of this product that we can deliver sooner  to learn more about pricing, market size, and technical challenges?&#8221;</p>
<p>If  we had done so, we would have discovered:</p>
<div id="bullets">
<ul>
<li>whether the need  was great enough (and if the solution was good enough) to convince  people to open their wallets</li>
<li>that while a few users acutely  felt the pain of slow tests, most didn&#8217;t care about acceleration.  However, many of those users did want a &#8220;simpler&#8221; application &#8211;  non-accelerated Ruby cloud testing.</li>
<li>the primary technical  challenge was not accelerating tests, it was configuring servers for  customers&#8217; Rails applications. Not only did we spend time focusing on  the wrong technical challenges, we also made architectural decisions  that actually made it harder to solve this core problem.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>After  eventually discovering that setup and configuration was our primary  adoption problem (and after trying and failing to implement various  strategies to make it simple and easy), we tried to move to the other  end of the spectrum. Caliper was designed to provide value with zero  setup or configuration &#8211; users just provided a link to source code and  instantly got valuable data.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we again made the  mistake of focusing on engineering first and customer development  second. We released our first version to some moderate success and then  proceeded to continue to churn out features without really understanding  customer needs. Only later on, after finally engaging potential  customers did we realize that market was too small and price point was  to low to have Caliper sustain our company by itself.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This  is by no means a comprehensive list, but it is our hope that other  startups and founders-to-be can learn from our experiences, both  mistakes and successes. Doing a startup has been an incredible learning  experience for both Dan and I and we look forward to learning more in  the future &#8211; both first-hand and from the amazing group of entrepreneurs  and hackers that we&#8217;ve been privileged enough to know.</p>

	<p>Very sound advice. Especially interesting to see your thoughts on technical founders. I&#039;m a marketing/vision kind of guy. I can lay the groundwork for technology, but I can&#039;t make the tech side of it all work.</p>
<p>That&#039;s where I&#039;m hung up in my own ambitions. Business guys like myself can&#039;t make a startup with the tech people, and it&#039;s interesting to see that acknowledged on your end.</p>
<p>The skill sets are mutually exclusive. Tech people can create and ideate great feature sets, but it&#039;s the marketing/biz guy that can analyze the market opportunity and measure the benefits a service offers. After all, it&#039;s all about benefits, not features.</p>

<p>By chance are you guys going to be at Boulder.me?  Myself and another local AZ startup guy are trekking up there next week &#8211; maybe we can buy you a beer?</p>

	<p>Can you elaborate on how you discovered that the market wasn&#8217;t large enough to support caliper? Did you ask beta testers what the were willing to pay &amp; then extrapolate that to the estimated number of users (how did you find that number?) and then you realized it wouldn&#8217;t be enough $ to survive, or was it not enough money to get bought by someone paying millions? What was your original goal for $, and how did that change over time, ie did it start at millions and go down as you got desperate for customers, or were you more conservative at the start? Did you use any methodology when writing your vision, building the product, testing with potential users, pivoting, etc, or did you make it up as you went along? Lots of questions, please keep blogging thanks</p>

	<p>I probably won&#039;t get into details of everything. On the Caliper project we starte signing up private beta users and discussing price with them. We quickly learned that what they were willing to pay for the service couldn&#039;t sustain a company on it&#039;s own. It could be used to help up sell other products or services (consulting). When looking at what people would pay and the expected number of paying customers over time, it just didn&#039;t make sense to continue with the product as the primary goal of a funded company.</p>

	<p>Thank you Ben (&amp; Dan) for taking the time to dissect and analyze your experience with Devver.<br />
What really impressed me the most is when you say &quot;we should have focused more on customer development and finding a minimum viable product (MVP) . . . &quot;, that is probably the most critical piece in any startup or any project, what is the next logical step?<br />

	<p>Customer development is an ongoing process. Once you&#039;ve identified an MVP (which is an iterative process itself), the next step is to keep iterating as you add or improve features. Measure how the product is performing along key metrics, talk to customers, merge customer feedback with your vision, build and improve features, and then do it all over again!</p>
