It was the first step towards the eventual goal of creating a wearable, synthetic spinal/neural networked, body sensing platform, which you can read more about in the project logs.<br /><br />This was the basis of my startup that went completely bust. Ran out of money for further development, and got dicked around by people who I formerly trusted for far too long. Still, I learned a ton from that experience. Like who to trust, not to trust, what advice is solid, and what advice is pure crap. In anycase, I figure documenting your failures so you learn from them, is far more important than successes. <br /><br />My loss is your gain.<br /><br />If you have any questions about the pod, etc, you can contact me at nghiemdesigns [at] gmail [dot] com.

                            <p><p>My product goal was to get an integrated microcontroller digital/analog SEMG pod put together to measure the electrical signals coming from your muscles when you innervate them. In that aspect, I succeeded. The unit combines an Arduino to control the digital circuitry, mainly a digital pot, which adjusted the gain for the analog circuitry, which is a bunch of diff amp and op amp circuits, to read in the SEMG signal (Surface ElectroMyographic) signal from the skin. A half wave rectifier took care of the negative aspects of the signal, and then it was further smoothed with filters to create something that you can use in digital circuitry. The arduino's primary function is to control the digital pot, and to map and output the resulting signal to an LED driver, which displayed your muscle signal level on the LED's.<br><br>It was the first step towards the eventual goal of creating a wearable, synthetic spinal/neural networked, body sensing platform, which you can read more about here:<br><br><a href="http://hackaday.io/project/4716-control-things-with-your-muscles/log/15855-the-wearable-synthetic-spine-and-the-school-of-hardware-startup-hard-knocks-lesson-1">The Wearable Synthetic Spine, and the School of Hardware Startup Hard Knocks - Lesson 1</a><br><br>You can see the circuit design progression from start to finish here.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/5152221426533945615.jpg"><br>The basis of this product is my Senior Design Project, titled, <a target="_blank" href="http://transanthro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IT2000.pdf">A Smart Suit for Microgravity Environments</a> which I worked on with the MIT Aero Astro Lab, and the Boston University Neuromuscular Research Center from 1997 to 2000! Holy crap that was a long time ago. <br><br>What I built at the time was an SEMG activated force arm, essentially a robotic arm that was strapped to an Astronaut's arm, and it used nitinol wires, SMA's, as artificial muscles to apply an opposing force to the arm. The whole idea was to stress the arm in the opposite direction of movement so that the astronaut's muscles didn't deteriorate. </p><p>I used the Hill muscle model to build an artificial muscle arm, and the SEMG signals I collected were processed at the time in Matlab and Simulink. <br><br>You can see it in action here.</p><iframe style="width: 500px; height: 281px;" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qGaYVagVw0Q" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" width="500"></iframe>

                            <p><p>This week we address algorithms, code, and appearance. Or cases. <br></p><p>Let's start with code. For a device like this, where we're not interested in doing any kind of medical work - plus we don't want nor need to deal with the FDA - and it's just involved in controlling digital outputs for lights, artificial muscles, servos, etc, you don't need a lot of accuracy. The Arduino's 10 bit ADC is sufficient for most project needs when it comes to that. That greatly simplifies our processing. The basic functional requirement is to read in the SEMG signal, map the signal out to the PWM ports of the TLC5940NT in ascending order, and allow for software interrupts using soft IRQ's for button push instances so that when the button is pushed, the MCP42XX digital pot either lowers the resistance or increases the resistance to increase or decrease the gain so we don't oversaturate the final output signal. </p><p><br>The Atmega328P we're using is the low powered one, which works at 3.3V. Obviously if our signal overshoots 3.3V, we won't get a useful reading, so having the gain adjustable on the fly is necessary. </p><p><br>Right now, as it is, the program is a hack, due to the preliminary board being manufactured proof of concept. So, a lot of the dedicated serial channels that the Arduino uses isn't standardized across the board. Instead of the I2C port, which is the Analog 4 and 5 ports, we have it occupied by the switches for the MCP42XX, which is the SPI digital Pot. For the SPI, which typically is PWM 11, 12, and 13, we have that taken up by the TLC5940NT. </p><p><br>That's a real mess.<br><br>Anyway, here is the flowchart program for the circuitry. <br><br></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1322071429564388199.jpeg"></p><p>And here's the code.

                            <p><p>Ah, weight. It's the perennial First World problem, in an overly politically correct society. And it's the part of the circuit that we want to vastly reduce and size down.</p><p>After we refined the circuitry, it was time to lay out the board and manufacture the PCB. We got to this point because as I attempted to make another basement, wire jumpered, ghetto board, my left over solder slag caused shorts and fried chips. I talked to Al, and he said to not even bother, since the proof of concept was solid, and I extensively tested my other hand made board. It was time to make something cleaner, smaller, and better. </p><p>I'm a total dunce when it comes to PCB board design and software, like Altium Designer or EagleCAD, which is what Aleks had access to. However, for circuit schematics, I used gEDA, which is an excellent piece of software for anyone who isn't rolling in cash to do their circuit schematic.<br><br><strong>Artificial Muscle Control</strong><br><br></p><p>It's about this time that I really started thinking through the applications for my concept, and the first concept that came to my mind, was in robotics. Which brings me back to my ancient 1990's thesis, <a href="http://transanthro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IT2000.pdf">A Smart Suit for Microgravity Environments</a></p><p>Digital control of artificial muscles is a tricky problem. The problem with the current solutions out on the market today for artificial muscles, at least the kinds that make me think of an artificial muscle, is that they're not really digitally controllable. That's Shape Memory Alloys, IE. Nitinol wire, or shape memory polymers. Every Shape Memory substance requires heat or heat production for it to do the bending and contorting that makes it a muscle. And the problem with heat is the lag time for the material to absorb enough heat to result in a hysteresis, where the crystal structure, or whatever structure starts to rearrange itself into a different geometric form, resulting in a contracting element.</p><p>And because the hysteresis is heat dependent, and depends on the overall amorphous shape of the SMA/SMP, you don't get good control over the element. Now contrast that with biological muscles.</p><p><strong>The Digital Nature of Biological Muscles</strong></p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/7794521428509365508.jpg"></p><p>Biological muscles are formed of muscle fibers that ratchet against each other, with a myosin and actin element. Think car jack hoists. Much like a ratchet, they work in discrete steps with each other. You know what the crazy thing is about biological muscles? They're far better structurally for something resembling digital control. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/8717401428509442180.jpg"></p><p>That's because muscle fibers have a discrete nature. They use calcium ions, which have a defined energetic value, to initiate the muscle innervation. Basically, the entire muscle fiber is in a potential state, except it's covered with a sheet of tropomyosin. Each calcium ion tugs a bit of that sheet away, exposing binding sites on myosin. The actin filament instantly latches onto those myosin sites, creating a muscle ratcheting effect, aka the contraction.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/2122941428509472609.jpg"></p><p>You can read more about how the muscle works here.</p><p><a href="http://mollythrodahl.com/2012/02/28/skeletal-muscle-physiology/">How Skeletal Muscles Work</a><br></p><p>Each calcium ion, and each actin/myosin unit makes a defined, structural, energetically activated biomechanical unit. Say that 6 times fast. Anyway, that makes it a clear analog to digital.</p><p>On top of that, not all of your muscle fibers activate at once when you innervate them. The only time you really see your muscles innervate almost at once is when you induce a massive shock to the muscle. That's why you hear stories of people who accidentally touched a massive circuit, get knocked out and find themselves 15 feet away. It wasn't a massive spark or explosion that knocked them back there. It was the shock that triggered their muscles to contract violently all at once. Now, if the contraction caused them to rigidly hold the electrical source, most likely they'd be dead. If the contraction caused them to leap back and let go of the source, more likely they'll still be alive. And when they woke up, that is, if they weren't dead, they felt really really sore. I know I did when I got hit!<br><br><strong>Working with Artificial...</strong></p>

                            <p><p>So now we get into the meat of the tech. The good stuff. The Biomedical Engineering coke. It's where the silicon meets the carbon road, where synthetic "life" meets organic "life."<br><br>The blending of biology and physics was what got me into biomedical engineering in the first place. Meshing organic with inorganic has this perverse pull for me. Yes, I was the one who found the Borg queen in Star Trek Voyager, the Matrix human batteries, and anime cyborgs sexy as hell, especially with all the attachments put on em. Do I have a sick fetish? Maybe. Is it Visionary? Absolutely.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/7243081427990299834.jpg"></p><p><br>I started down this path when I was 5 years old, and licked a nine volt battery. That buzz was what got me going. When I was ten, I dissected disposable cameras, and gave myself severe shocks from the flash capacitor as an experiment, and for fun. I also got hit by lightning when I was in college, but that's a story for another day. Since day one, I've had this strange predeliction for electricity and the body, and attaching hardware to my body, for good or bad, is very natural for me.<br><br>Naturally I gravitated to muscles and electronics. So what better thing to work with than SEMG? Let's sing the Body Electric.<br><strong><br>And now for a lesson in Surface Electromyography, or SEMG for short. </strong><br></p><p><img src="http://www.austincc.edu/apreview/NursingPics/PNSefferentPics/Picture16.jpg"></p><p><br>An SEMG signal is an electrical wave that cascades down your muscle. That wave is generated when something called a Motor Unit Action Potential, MUAP, which is a combination of muscle neurons (Motor Neuron) and muscle fibers, starts with a discharge of a set of neuron potentials. <br><br>Those potentials are formed from the separation of sodium and potassium - which are positive ions - and chloride ions - which are negative ions - inside of the neural cell synapse, which is that long, tenuous line in the neural cell circuit. At the end point of the neural cell, where the neural electrical discharge ends, it releases neurotransmitters into the muscle cells, which in turn releases cascades of calcium ions, and that triggers the muscle fibers to contract. Now you know why salt, bananas, milk and leafy greens are important for your diet.<br><br>That discharge wave cascades down your muscle, creating what's called a Motor Unit Action Potential Train, which is a long line of MUAP's discharging to the end of the muscle. That end, is where the muscle is attached to ligaments or tendons, which in turn are attached to skeletal bone. And that's why you need a ground near bone to complete the circuit. <br><br>The full electrical discharge is both motor neural cells discharging, and muscle potentials discharging, ending with one giant, cascade of voltages coming out from your muscles. Which gets really messy, and complicated looking. Like this.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/2121631427989487794.jpg"></p><p><br>What the electrode is measuring is the muscle discharge from the calcium ions. Lost somewhere in that signal are the motor neuron cells, but those aren't that important to look at for our purposes.</p><p>To read electrical signals from muscles, we start with a differential amplifier, aka a diff amp. You need the diff amp because it subtracts the voltage values measured between the two electrodes.</p><p>All the diff amp does is it measures a point in the wave, versus another point in the wave, while the ground provides a base reference. When it subtracts those values, you have a voltage value from the muscle, and that's the signal you're working with.</p><p>Now, some SEMG circuits use a single electrode, and a ground. Others, like the one we're using, use the belly of the muscle, the ending of the muscle (right where it attaches to tendons), and the ground. You can also get crazier with triple, quad electrodes to get as much signal value as possible. </p><p>This improves the resolution of the signal, because of the number of contact points on the skin. But it also gets a lot more uncomfortable. There's a lot of metal shafing on your skin all in a concentrated point.</p><p><br>Good instrumentation diff amps meet these minimum parameters. </p><ol><li> Low internal noise (&lt;0.5 mV)</li><li>High input impedance (&gt;100 MΩ)</li><li>Flat bandwidth and sharp high...</li></ol>

                    <p>Actually, along the lines of what you're doing, I have an experimental setup in the garage for making those fishingline muscles. I wanted to try those out in conjunction&nbsp;with the SEMG to see if I can make an artifical controlled twitch muscle. I don't suppose you're producing and selling them right now? Or got any you can send over to play with? I also looked at soft robotics muscles as a possibility, but having grown up playing Battletech, and spending hours on their tech read outs, I'm much more predisposed to the fiber muscle concept.</p>

Tell you what, give me an idea of what the spec out is for driving your muscles, and I'll go ahead and prototype something along those lines that I can control with the sensor that we can attach it to.

So I controlled it with a relay. Course, at some point, the heat was so great through the wires that they started to cook and smoke. You know what's funny? I built that thing for astronauts to use.

                    <p>Here's what I think. Instead of using higher resistance, have you <br>done any tests using oscillating current in alternating fibers? When it <br>comes to our muscles, not every single fiber activates on innervation. <br>What's your experimental setup and control, and procedure? I'm thinking <br>along the lines if you can do some basic experiments with the fibers to <br>see how they act with oscillating current, around, say 1-30HZ, and then <br>create a setup where you have, for example, 2 fibers, 1 innervated, the <br>other not, both attached to the weight that your testing it on. I don't <br>know how much you know about muscles, but that was my bread an butter <br>back in the day with making artificial muscles, and we used the Hill <br>Muscle model, which had a compressive element, and a spring element. <br>What I would try to replicate is something along those lines, where one <br>fiber is active, that's your compressible, and the other is not, that's <br>your spring, and they work in tandem with each other.&nbsp;<br>If you can <br>shoot me a mesg with your email, I can sketch up a drawing for you <br>regarding what I'm talking about. A picture is worth a thousand words...</p><p><br><br>Shoot, you know what? I'll just put that concept in one of the blog posts, about the artifiicial muscles I built.</p>

                    <p>Hey Dude, (You're a dude, right?)&nbsp;<br>Went through some of your <br>stuff. I was wondering, since at the moment you don't have a full <br>prototype, have you done any tests on the filament muscles by cycling <br>heat at frequency intervals? Reason I ask is it seems like so far, we <br>only have results to what happens when you apply heat at a slow cycle. <br>But nothing in the Hertz range on down. One idea I've toyed with is to <br>get heating element wire (like the stuff in toasters), and weaving that <br>into the fishing line to see what that does. Have you tried that or do <br>you know if anyone else has tried that? Cause once you can apply current<br> directly, then we can start applying my tech to it.</p>

                    <p>That would be an interesting way of doing it! The ones at the doctor's office just play a click with each muscle impulse detected, so it sounds a bit like a radiation counter. It's not unpleasant, though not what I would consider to be musical. It is interesting, however.&nbsp;</p><p>This leads me to another question, is your device sensitive enough to pick up individual muscle impulses? I know that sensitivity is an issue due to detecting through the skin, I'm just curious if it's possible to pick up the individual impulses like a needle type EMG can. I noticed a few quick pulses on the LED bar in your video. Do those represent individual pulses or many?</p><p>Sorry to keep pelting you with questions. <br></p>

                    <p>Hmm. Well, the way your muscles work is you have to start with the most basic unit, and that's what's called the MUAP, or Motor Unit Action Potential. That's a group of muscles signaled by a set of neurons. So, if you mean impulse as in one of those, then you "might" get the impulse. What you see on the LED display is basically a cascading wave of energy released and running down the muscle. So, it's not an impulse per say, but more like watching a wave. Ever watch a wave roll down the coast before slamming into the beach? That's a lot like what watching an SEMG signal is like. I wouldn't be able to say that any one of those points is an impulse, but if we took out all the filters I have on my thing, and the half wave rectifier, than yeah, you can see the impulse. But the problem is just having that SEMG signal itself isn't all that useful for anything other than diagnostic purposes (like determining if your muscles are tired, degraded). Whereas the way I have it set up now, it's designed to use variable voltage to control stuff, kinda like when you roll a digital pot clockwise and counter clockwise.&nbsp;<br><br>I can imagine that if I hooked up the LED driver instead to say, a music chip where each level of voltage goes with a piano key, it's like running your finger on the piano keyboard up and down.&nbsp;<br><br>Course, that could be more pleasant than the "Holy crapcakes Batman, your muscles sound like nuclear waste!" sound that you get from the Doc's instruments.<br><br>This sounds interesting though. Gonna have to dig up some sound chips to stick on this sucka...<br><br><br></p>

                    <p>Well, my Dad, who had hip replacement surgery, and was undergoing quite a lot of physical therapy would fall into that class. I did a few experiments with his leg and the sensors just to monitor the level of innervation. Unfortunately, SEMG has two massive technical issues. The first major issue is you're not going to get an overall picture of the muscle innervation. The sensor only picks up parts of the signal at the surface of the skin. To get a much higher fidelity signal, you need insertable needle sensors. I don't know a lot of people who'd be willing to have needles inserted into their muscles to pick up the signal. The other major technical issue with SEMG is noise that comes from the contact of the electrode to the skin, if it shifts, and the noise that appears when the muscles move and rub under the skin. So, you're not going to get a very good picture of the muscle disorder. That said, you will discern a noticeable difference in SEMG signals between a healthy muscle, and a muscle that's effected by a disorder. With some signal processing, you'd also see some frequency shifts between a muscle that's healthy, vs. a muscle that has the disorder.&nbsp;<br>I see SEMG as just one sensor in what should be a broad suite of sensors, each one used to compensate for the deficiencies in each other. It's just I've spent so much of my time just on SEMG.</p><p><br><br>Not sure if I answered your question, but in a nutshell, it "might" help, but that depends on your application and what you're going for.</p>

                    <p>Hmm, if you have the studies done before the myopathy got bad, you "might" have a control that you can compare it too. The problem with approaching this with SEMG is because everyone is different, you don't have a baseline SEMG signal of when you were "healthy", vs. now. In fact, for all you know, you've been living with this the whole time, so getting a healthy muscle SEMG signal is, um, a long shot. Myopathy, at least from what I read, means inflammation and a lot more creatine enzymes floating around. So, you'll be burning off a lot more energy, which would mean you'd have more noisy muscles. Maybe a good way to figure out your myopathy would be to have SEMG only as a supplement, but a kinetic motion analysis of the muscle system in question. You can see a lot more from gait and compensation when you're moving, as your muscles will be a lot more innervated than normal folks. At least, that's what I'm guessing based on what I've just read about your condition.&nbsp;<br><br>This could be a fun project in that regard. I'd be down with making something that does that...<br><br></p>

                    <p>Inflammation is right. My CRP level (an <br>inflammation indicator) was 25 the last time it was checked, and was at <br>15 for at least 10 years before that. Normal is 1 or less, and between 2<br> and 3 usually means that an infection is present. At least that's the <br>way I understand it.&nbsp;I'm not a physician or even someone who's studied <br>medicine. I have tried to educate myself on the things I'm dealing with,<br> however, so much of the terminology is familiar to me.<br>As for my <br>gait, I walk with a cane, so it's certain to be abnormal. You can also <br>add peripheral neuropathy to the myopathy, which is believed to be one <br>of the verities of metabolic myopathy. In other words, the tips of my <br>nerves don't work and my skeletal muscles are starving. I have other <br>issues, but those are the two that affect my muscles the most.</p><p><br><br>You<br> are correct about not having a healthy baseline, but I think it would <br>be interesting to see what SEMG measurements would turn up in my case. <br>However, I think this will have to remain a theoretical idea.</p>
