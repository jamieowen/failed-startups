We stopped working on the app and devoted all of our resources to repacking our backend technology to solve BigCo’s problems. Instead of paring down expenses to extend our dwindling runway, we piled on hires and ramped up our infrastructure.</p><p name="3c51" id="3c51" class="graf--p">The daily deals space imploded but we spent nearly nine months, dozens of meetings, and several hundred thousand dollars “selling” Sonar into a company that nearly went bankrupt.</p><p name="fe24" id="fe24" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Lesson Learned:</em></strong></p><p name="cdfe" id="cdfe" class="graf--p">Companies don’t get sold, they get bought. The best way to get bought is to build something of value. That’s hard to do when you are trying to sell.</p><h4 name="c0bb" id="c0bb" class="graf--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Misalignment</strong></h4><p name="78ab" id="78ab" class="graf--p">We built Sonar out of an incubator that I helped launch in 2010. To be absolutely clear, the incubator was instrumental to getting Sonar off the ground and helped us considerably along the way. Unfortunately, there are a number of structural issues facing incubators and the operators they employ. I address some of these below.</p><p name="860d" id="860d" class="graf--p">The decoupling of responsibility from control created ambiguity and confusion, tension and frustration for all parties. From day to day decisions such as negotiating an employment contract to company defining ones such as when to sell the firm, alignment was a constant challenge. Occasionally, we were simply at odds.</p><p name="5387" id="5387" class="graf--p">Perhaps the most detrimental aspect of the incubator model was not its potential for hinderance but its facility as a crutch. As someone responsible for building and running a company that I ultimately didn’t control, it was far too easy to point a finger.</p><p name="4403" id="4403" class="graf--p">In my opinion, the most tragic example came when our incubator sat on a financing that would have rebooted the company. After nearly a month at loggerheads, our would-be investors gave us 48 hours to “take it or leave it.” In hopes of saving the company, I made an ultimatum: we move forward together or I would have to walk away. No one budged, time elapsed, and our term sheet evaporated. I resigned as promised, blaming them for killing my baby.</p><p name="5176" id="5176" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Lesson Learned:</em></strong></p><p name="be21" id="be21" class="graf--p graf--last">As John Burroughs said, “A man can fail many times, but he isn’t a failure until he begins to blame somebody else.” Avoid bad relationships like the plague but when you inevitably find yourself in a difficult partnership, don’t waste precious energy wailing against it. Make it work or move on quickly.</p></div></div></section><section name="5b98" class=" section--content"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><h3 name="6513" id="6513" class="graf--h3 graf--first"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">It’s All About People</strong></h3><blockquote name="3ba3" id="3ba3" class="graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">“The essence of competitiveness is liberated when we make people believe that what they think and do is important – and then get out of their way while they do it.” — Jack Welch</blockquote><h4 name="5a2c" id="5a2c" class="graf--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Be practical about team building</strong></h4><p name="edd6" id="edd6" class="graf--p">We lost our first would-be hire, a fantastic Google engineer. While we were debating his contract, he was taking a job elsewhere. Conversely, we hired another, much less proven, engineer on the spot. While he ultimately wasn’t a great cultural fit and we definitely waited too long to part ways, he was instrumental in getting V1 out the door.</p><p name="9190" id="9190" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Lesson Learned:</em></strong></p><p name="cca0" id="cca0" class="graf--p">If you are an experienced entrepreneur with lots of options, by all means, hold out. For most first time entrepreneurs, holding out risks never getting off the ground.</p><p name="d794" id="d794" class="graf--p">In the beginning, established people probably won’t work with you. Prove yourself by finding diamonds in the rough, like yourself. With their help, you can level up your organization and convince the big fish to join.</p><h4 name="6803" id="6803" class="graf--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Culture is your cofounder</strong></h4><p name="4f0c" id="4f0c" class="graf--p">We built an amazing team at Sonar. Everyone was extremely smart, passionate, dedicated, and hardworking. We celebrated milestones with tequila. We hung at the beach. Even when times were tough, everyone pushed as far as they possibly could, and then some. I have big love for all of my former colleagues and am confident they feel similarly.</p><p name="4567" id="4567" class="graf--p">That said, our culture was more of an emergent property than a deliberate choice. Sure, we had brainstorming sessions and posted goals prominently but most of our culture we absorbed from the people with whom we surrounded ourselves.</p><p name="01fb" id="01fb" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Lesson Learned:</em></strong></p><p name="0ee0" id="0ee0" class="graf--p">Think of culture as a cofounder that is present when you are not. You are decisive, communicative, and respectful but it’s your culture that helps everyone know how to act when you are out of the room. Give that voice clarity and authority.</p><p name="523d" id="523d" class="graf--p graf--last">The trick is to avoid hollow words. Since a startup’s culture ultimately mirrors that of its founder, maybe the best thing that you can do is work hard to get clear on who you are. Write that down and share it with your team. If you’ve been honest, every action you take will reinforce your values.</p></div></div></section><section name="32d9" class=" section--content section--last"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><h3 name="2bb0" id="2bb0" class="graf--h3 graf--first"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Onward</strong></h3><p name="7dfa" id="7dfa" class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">“What we fight with is so small, and when we win, it makes us small.

I ultimately stepped away from Sonar when I came to the conclusion that, despite all that we had invested, everyone stood a better chance starting anew. It’s difficult to accept, but sometimes you have to concede a battle to win the war.</p><p name="04ed" id="04ed" class="graf--p">I am indebted to the hundreds of people that invested their sweat, money, love, and/or time into Sonar, be it three years of labor or a casual phone call. Special thanks to my amazing team, faithful advisors &amp; investors, and supportive family &amp; friends. Finally, huge shout out to the millions of users that gave Sonar a shot. Your stories about meeting your boyfriend on Sonar made it all worthwhile.</p><p name="d233" id="d233" class="graf--p">We started Sonar with a belief that everyone has the potential to be amazing and that technology can unlock that potential.
