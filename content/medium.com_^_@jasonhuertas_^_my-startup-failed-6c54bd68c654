And most first-time entrepreneurs don’t listen to advice very well (especially first-time CEOs — I know I didn’t). The trait that makes you believe that you can be the statistical anomaly is actually the same trait that gives you blinders when you are in the startup trenches for the first time. You think that you know it all.

Not all advice is created equal, and knowing which advice to take is very hard. But even though they may not necessarily be right, you should at least consider their advice. They are trying to prevent you from falling where they have fallen before. Since my startup failed, I have returned to my mentors, to let them know how much I appreciated their advice, and how much I wish I had listened to them earlier.</p><h3 name="cc72" id="cc72" class="graf--h3">Your Idea Is Not Special</h3><p name="6bc6" id="6bc6" class="graf--p graf--empty"><br></p><p name="7f32" id="7f32" class="graf--p">Annotating the web is not a new concept.

Now that doesn’t mean it will never work (I still believe it will). But with my first-time founder blinders on, it didn’t matter that others failed, those people were not us — <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">we</em> were better, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">we</em> were going to succeed.</p><p name="4ed6" id="4ed6" class="graf--p">I didn’t dive deep and learn from others who have tried and failed at executing the idea. There were definitely key learnings that I picked up along the way, after we had already built the product. I could have easily learned the same things before we wrote even a single line of code. And that would have vastly changed our focus, and saved us a lot of time.</p><h3 name="2b12" id="2b12" class="graf--h3">Version 0 ≠ Version 1</h3><p name="11c6" id="11c6" class="graf--p graf--empty"><br></p><p name="32d4" id="32d4" class="graf--p">At v1, you already have a product that people are using.
