Then I realized that the path of grad school, professor, grants, and incremental research wouldn’t be a great way to pursue this goal. At the same time, I read Paul Graham’s essay on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">How to Start a Startup</a>. I felt a strong sense of “I could do this!” and “making a lot of money from a startup and using it to do something good” would be a better way of pursuing my goals of doing something important.</p><p name="2379" id="2379" class="graf--p">Throughout sophomore year I read all I could about startups, and about things like finance, marketing, strategy, economics, design, technology etc. The following summer I started learning some HTML, CSS, JS and PHP, but didn’t make much progress (I also started a very early version of the website that I’m writing this post about).</p><p name="6c30" id="6c30" class="graf--p">The following year I thought about starting the startup during the year, but decided not to. It was a busy year with classes, and a good <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?_r=0" data-href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?_r=0" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">opportunity</a> to be social and to be a college student.

The question isn’t “How much value am I offering to a user that is currently on the site”. The question is, “How do I get a user to give it a shot in the first place”. People associate bad design with bad quality, and often won’t give bad design a fair chance. That is a fact that I didn’t account for enough in my analysis of the design of my site. Partly because I didn’t understand users enough, and partly because I spent too much time winning arguments against weak opponents and not enough time <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/write-your-hypothetical-apostasy.html" data-href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/write-your-hypothetical-apostasy.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">thinking up and arguing against</a> the strongest counter arguments I could find.</p><p name="c4e5" id="c4e5" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I underestimated the difficulty of the coding.<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em></strong>I was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">bad</em> at coding.

I increased the amount I’d incentivize very slowly and experimented in series (one after another). This took way too long. I should have realized that smaller amounts of money weren’t working and I should have experimented in parallel. Doing each of these things would have been a bit more costly, and I was hesitant to spend money, but I think that the time it would have saved me would have made it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">easily</em> worth it.</p><p name="5705" id="5705" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I should have been more committed to getting an MVP working.</strong> I spent a lot of time asking people for advice, and “focus on an MVP” was the main thing they told me.
