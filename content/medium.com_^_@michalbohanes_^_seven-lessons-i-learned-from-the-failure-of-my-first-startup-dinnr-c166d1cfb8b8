Select a recipe on our website, and we deliver everything you need to cook that recipe at home, all the items pre-measured with printed instructions. All you need at home is oil, salt and pepper and a reasonably equipped kitchen.)</em></p><p name="7e47" id="7e47" class="graf--p">It all ended on 12 January 2014, when I decided not to accept a small second round of investment I had secured via crowd-funding platform Seedrs. Seedrs knew about the difficulties we were in and we agreed with the Seedrs team that it was best to cancel the investment. I had run out of ideas on how to turn things around, how to make people buy our product. The only thing I would do with this money would be to try to acquire more infrequent customers and keep the lights on for another few months. No way it would be an investment that would give investors a 10x return.</p><p name="9790" id="9790" class="graf--p">It wouldn’t have been enough money to pivot to another business model. No one (myself included) even had a good hypothesis on what it could be that would work in London and that we could leverage our assets for.</p><p name="810c" id="810c" class="graf--p">I wasn’t particularly tired. Even after months of fruitless trying, I was as keen to make things happen as in the early days, but I did feel like I arrived at the end of a dead-end street. Pulling the plug radically was the only reasonable (and ethical) thing to do.</p><p name="86e6" id="86e6" class="graf--p">In those days, I spent 9 hours a day, 6 days a week, sitting in a cold warehouse in West Acton, hot air blowers creating 25 degree bubbles around parts of my body in an otherwise 14–15 degree room. The large industrial fridges were empty. Long gone were the days I pre-stocked ingredients for faster order fulfillment. Now, when an order would come through, I would jump on my bike and buy fresh ingredients at a nearby superstore. After 15 months of operations, we had approximately one order per day, generating on average £26 in revenue and supposedly 30% in gross margin, but given the low volumes, we were losing money on every order.</p><figure name="f0af" id="f0af" class="graf--figure"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class="aspect-ratio-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*MSR9nSs9kwR0W5bz3Md5jg.jpeg" data-width="5616" data-height="3744" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*MSR9nSs9kwR0W5bz3Md5jg.jpeg" src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*MSR9nSs9kwR0W5bz3Md5jg.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="f190" id="f190" class="graf--p">Now, with the distance of a few months, it sounds positively crazy to run a “business” like this. But of course, one sticks to the guns because one has set out to make things happen and one has an obligation to investors. And then there’s the adage of “a winner never quits”, tales of entrepreneur legends who lost all their money, got abandoned by family and friends, were so hungry that they ate cardboard, only to triumph in the end and build a global empire.</p><p name="7994" id="7994" class="graf--p">But I had realized that it was over. Dinnr simply didn’t have legs (never had them to begin with, to be explained below) and I had reached an inner state where continuing would have been insane. After having spent tens of thousands of pounds of my personal money and working obsessively on an idea that had inspired me for a long time, I felt that I had given it all and that it was time to move on.</p><p name="53b4" id="53b4" class="graf--p">This rather long blog post is about my <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">lessons learned </strong>and is a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">post mortem. </strong>I will try not to go too much into the Dinnr specifics. Most of the readers of this post will not be interested in Dinnr itself. Instead, I will try to reflect on my 18 months and 12 days of entrepreneurship and see what I can come up with that will be applicable to any startup.</p><p name="eb51" id="eb51" class="graf--p">Rock’n’Roll.</p><p name="fc9e" id="fc9e" class="graf--p graf--empty"><br></p><p name="7db9" id="7db9" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Lesson #1: Are you solving an actual problem?</strong></p><p name="379e" id="379e" class="graf--p">I will never forget the shock of the first week, September 2012: Our surveys had indicated big demand coming up (70% of 250 target market respondents had said they would buy the product), our alpha test group gave us thumbs up, and in-depth 1 on 1 interviews also showed that we’re on to something. People really liked the idea!</p><p name="e221" id="e221" class="graf--p">So on the first day, we stacked the veggies and herbs, bought from wholesalers (not from supermarkets, pah! We were taking advantage of economies of scale!). We expected a torrent of orders.</p><p name="79ab" id="79ab" class="graf--p">The torrent ended up being a trickle and we got knocked out of La-La land back into reality.

We’re running a big business here!</figcaption></figure><p name="4e46" id="4e46" class="graf--p">This will be the number one lesson I will never forget and the absolute key to understanding Dinnr’s failure — <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">we were not solving anyone’s problem. </strong>I should have found that out in my initial market research, especially in my 1–1 interviews.</p><p name="bee7" id="bee7" class="graf--p">However, we committed the big mistake of presenting people with the idea and asking them if they liked it and would buy it.

Once. Then I’ll take a risk with the zombies.”</em></blockquote><p name="bf75" id="bf75" class="graf--p">There never was a need for a service like ours in the UK in the segment that we picked (urban professionals, couples without kids or with one baby max). And I deluded myself in thinking that there was, because I was eager to start my own thing and thought that this was something that I myself would use.</p><p name="43ac" id="43ac" class="graf--p">So where does this discrepancy come from? Why are people enthusiastic about the idea but then end up not buying? The problem is actually quite interesting. People give positive feedback on a new business idea for mainly two reasons:</p><p name="17ad" id="17ad" class="graf--p">a) People want to make you, the founder, happy.</p><p name="d3a4" id="d3a4" class="graf--p">I was aware of this risk at the time, and reminded everyone in the 1–1 interviews to be 100% honest with me. And in the end, I doubt anyone tried to flatter me. BY FAR BIGGER is the following, and at the time completely hidden to me, issue:</p><p name="c09f" id="c09f" class="graf--p">b) People are too optimistic about their future behaviour.</p><p name="475c" id="475c" class="graf--p">Especially when it’s about a product that has an aspirational halo around it. Dinnr was about learning to cook, eating healthier and home cooking — all things that most of us would agree are worthy, wholesome goals worth aspiring to. So, of course, the “new year’s resolution” effect kicks in — <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I genuinely resolve to be a better human being (and use Dinnr).</em></p><p name="64d6" id="64d6" class="graf--p">And as we all know, new year’s resolutions are made for breaking.</p><blockquote name="879a" id="879a" class="graf--blockquote">Side note: An interesting corollary of this software bug of the human mind is the “Such-A-Good-Idea Delusion” after the fact. You don’t know how many people, when they heard that we’re out of business, appeared genuinely sad and lamented “it was SUCH a good idea”. I tried not to sound passive-aggressive when I asked “well if it was such a good idea, why didn’t you use it?”. And then people went “well, you know, I’m too busy to cook” or “oh, yea, I guess you’re right…”. By that time, I found it funny: They got the lesson for free — I had to learn the hard way over 1.5 years. I myself was deluded by the promise of “such a good idea, and so useful!” into starting it in the first place, so I was the main victim (and perpetrator) of this mind bug.<br>Not every good idea is a good business. Duh.</blockquote><p name="c462" id="c462" class="graf--p">How does one detect the danger of being in “too optimistic about my own future behaviour territory”?</p><ul class="postList"><li name="ad01" id="ad01" class="graf--li">You’re being told by the prospective customer, after you explain the product: “…yeeeeeeah [the slow, hesitant kind of yeeeeah that shows that the usefulness of the product is slowly dawning on them], that is really good… That is really useful” with an expression on their face that indicates “I have not really thought about that but what you’re saying makes total sense and it’s SO TRUE!”. This is a red flag because if they haven’t really thought about it, it means that it’s not high priority enough for them to bother.</li><li name="0b23" id="0b23" class="graf--li">You learn that you’re not really solving a big enough problem for this particular customer but they still compliment you about it. What I mean with “big enough problem” is simple: Is the fact that they sometimes cook bland repetitive recipes or eat takeaway food an actual pain point for the customer? One that is so big that they would actually pay to get a solution for it? The answer in Dinnr’s case is a resounding NO, of course. In hindsight.</li><li name="d61f" id="d61f" class="graf--li">People compliment you on the idea because they believe it will be so useful for people<em class="markup--em markup--li-em">other than themselves — </em>I.e., they get into advisor mode. “I’m not much of a cook, so I might not be the best target audience for you, but this will be SO useful for young mothers…”. Intellectually, it’s clear to you in the moment that this is nothing but a hypothesis worth testing. However, emotionally, you get this warm fuzzy feeling “it’ll be SO useful to young mothers!” that further adds a hue of rose-tint to the glasses that are slowly forming on your nose.

The fact you haven’t started a company before is not a reason to go with something easy</strong></p><p name="efe2" id="efe2" class="graf--p">As background to this one, a biographic note is worth mentioning: Growing up in Austria, my brain had been marinating for years and years in a meme that was pervasive in my family, school and overall culture. That meme says</p><blockquote name="11b1" id="11b1" class="graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“To start a line of work, you have to dedicate a lot of time to studying it and preparing for it. And then, one day in the far future, you’ll be allowed to actually DO it.”</em></blockquote><p name="c693" id="c693" class="graf--p">With “studying” and “preparing”, this meme means lots of time spent by yourself, immersed in books and anticipating the time when you may step into the limelight.</p><p name="07a1" id="07a1" class="graf--p">This is how the Austrian school system works. You study long and hard and THEN the big day comes. EXAM time! Performance time! You have worked hard, now SHOW what you got. Your hard preparation time will be rewarded.</p><p name="011f" id="011f" class="graf--p">Contrast this to the anglo-saxon education model that I had the privilege to experience at London Business School. There, you are constantly being evaluated (class participation is part of your grade), very often you have to present in class (in contrast, I presented ONCE in five years of law studies in Vienna), you work in groups, and you run practical projects with actual companies (for me, at least four such projects at LBS in 18 months, zero in Vienna in five years).</p><p name="8da1" id="8da1" class="graf--p">As a result, this education system has much higher chances of producing people who actively DO rather than just absorb. People who are biased towards action and people who will apply their knowledge rather than regurgitate it at exam time, people who learn by doing rather than bookworms who leave uni at 30 without any practical experience. No surprise that the English-speaking world has a higher density of entrepreneurs (I realize I am a bit negative here and possibly not doing full justice to the differences between continental Europe and the UK, but I invite anyone to consider how many of your friends who wanted to go study abroad ended up choosing Austria or Germany. Case closed.)</p><p name="eed4" id="eed4" class="graf--p">An embodiment of the practical, meme-shattering approach was my MBA classmate and now very good friend John. He had a consulting background and wanted to get into Venture Capital. So before actually moving to London to do the MBA, he contacted several school alumni who worked in VC, lined up coffee chats with them and offered himself to work with them for free to learn.</p><p name="3ce9" id="3ce9" class="graf--p">Sounds completely normal to you, right? For me, that was nothing short of revolutionary. My Austrian meme-infused brain screamed “Are you crazy? You don’t KNOW this stuff! You did consulting and not VC. You first have to take at least a course, better a concentration on VC in the MBA and THEN you can possibly apply for a job. How on earth do you think you’ll be useful to them?” Well, turned out, he was pretty useful to them and subsequently got a job at one of the most prestigious VC firms in London.</p><p name="b7b6" id="b7b6" class="graf--p">Now, memes have the nasty habit of hiding in crevasses of one’s mind even when you think you’ve purged them. In my case, it came back in the form of the following concept that I had in my head when starting Dinnr:</p><blockquote name="4fd8" id="4fd8" class="graf--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">It’s a good enough business to run as my first startup. It’s relatively simple (e-commerce), I understand the value proposition, I understand the customer. It won’t be a billion dollar business, but it’s absolutely realistic that I could sell it for a few million in a few years. I will get very valuable experience at a low risk which I will then be able to use for future, bigger, projects.</em></blockquote><p name="5c12" id="5c12" class="graf--p">Can you see the Evil Meme hiding in there? If you rephrase the above it comes into full view:</p><blockquote name="afb4" id="afb4" class="graf--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">You can’t do anything too complex because you don’t have the expertise.</em></blockquote><p name="98df" id="98df" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The lesson is: All that matters is that I identify an opportunity. </strong>If I need market expertise, I will find someone or will learn it myself. If I need technical help, I will find someone or learn it myself. This is what evenings and weekends are for, when in a corporate job. Expertise in a domain helps of course and gives me more credibility with investors. But examples abound where entrepreneurs succeeded outside of their original domain.</p><p name="d7ee" id="d7ee" class="graf--p">You can develop yourself towards stepping up to the opportunity.

After all, it’s not like there is a vast cultural chasm between these two — it’s not, say, Japan vs UK. And it wouldn’t be the first time that a Swedish product conquers the world, right?

The market research still needs to be done as thoroughly as if there hadn’t been market proof elsewhere.</p><p name="d413" id="d413" class="graf--p">Apart from lacking a sophisticated online supermarket system like the UK, Scandinavia has a few cultural traits that make people much more susceptible to Dinnr-like services: As I’ve been told (after launch, unfortunately) by expats living in Sweden, the Swedes are generally much more attached to their routines than Brits. You can easily ask a Londoner at work if they’ll have a drink with the team after work. Ask a Scandi and chances are you’ll have to schedule it a few weeks in advance. They also have a much stronger “eat at home with your family” culture.</p><figure name="0e6d" id="0e6d" class="graf--figure"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 375px;"><div class="aspect-ratio-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*qIkskRScl1hn8XQCg2z_9A.jpeg" data-width="500" data-height="375" src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*qIkskRScl1hn8XQCg2z_9A.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="db47" id="db47" class="graf--p">It was one of the main things that kept me going: It’s working elsewhere so goddamit it must work here as well!</p><p name="1bd2" id="1bd2" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The lesson is: </strong>No, it doesn’t have to work in country 2 only because it works in country 1.</p><p name="5d6a" id="5d6a" class="graf--p">Jessica’s Recipe Bag (part of Linas Matkasse, the Swedish juggernaut in the space) has withdrawn from the UK market in early 2014, Housebites have packed it in in June 2014 and The Recipe Kit are also apparently not trading any more.

So naturally, finding a recipe that would solve both at once was very appealing.</p><p name="1c7a" id="1c7a" class="graf--p">However, 5 months later, after the new website was up and running and a brief flurry of new orders had come in, the repurchase rate went back to where it used to be. The hypothesis of “make it visually more appealing and people will come back more often because you address their emotions” hadn’t worked out.</p><p name="5fe5" id="5fe5" class="graf--p">The conclusion is — you can’t design your way out of a fundamental business flaw.</p><figure name="2dfc" id="2dfc" class="graf--figure"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 528px;"><div class="aspect-ratio-fill" style="padding-bottom: 105.60000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*MCQNx4G_JjSnk1g-HR3MWQ.jpeg" data-width="500" data-height="528" src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*MCQNx4G_JjSnk1g-HR3MWQ.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="7251" id="7251" class="graf--p">What I had overlooked at the time as well was the fact that one of her talents was design and that she was seeing the business’ problems mainly in that light.

Seedrs knew about the difficulties we were in and we agreed with the Seedrs team that it was best to cancel the investment. I had run out of ideas on how to turn things around, how to make people buy our product.

Now, when an order would come through, I would jump on my bike and buy fresh ingredients at a nearby superstore.
